The blog can be written in markdown, and it supports LaTeX math. For example, the quadratic formula is given by:
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

You can also include code snippets, like this Python example:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

You can also include images:
